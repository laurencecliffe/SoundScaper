# SoundScaper
SoundScaper is an audio augmented reality mobile application that allows users to author, save and reload virtual, and spatially interactive, binaural soundscapes within real world spaces. With SoundScaper, virtual audio content can be attached to specific coordinates in three-dimensional space, binaurally mixed and delivered to the listener through a standard pair of stereo headphones and percieved as being present within the listener's real world environment. Along with a specific position in virtual and real space, various other parameters can be set for virtual audio sources including: range, maximum volume, position relative to other virtual audio sources, rendering algorithm, looping or non-looping and reverb blend.
